                    A new study finds polar bears in the wild have higher metabolic rates than previously thought, and as
                    climate changes alters their environment a growing number of bear are unable to catch enough prey to
                    meet their energy needs.

                    The study, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6375/568">published February 2 in
                    <em>Science</em></a>, reveals the physiological mechanisms behind
                    observed declines in polar bear populations, said first author Anthony Pagano, a Ph.D. candidate at UC
                    Santa Cruz.

                    "We've been documenting declines in polar bear survival rates, body condition, and population numbers
                    over the past decade," he said. "This study identifies the mechanisms that are driving those declines by
                    looking at the actual energy needs of polar bears and how often they're able to catch seals."

                    Pagano, who is also a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), conducted the study as
                    part of his Ph.D. thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where he has been working with coauthors Terrie
                    Williams and Daniel Costa, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology.

                            At the end of the last ice age, a population of polar bears was stranded by the receding ice on a
                            few islands in southeastern Alaska. Male brown bears swam across to the islands from the Alaskan
                            mainland and mated with female polar bears, eventually transforming the polar bear population into
                            brown bears.
